Robots with legged locomotion have, over the years, demonstrated high flexibility, excellent dynamic stability and adaptability to different terrains and obstacles [1]. They have demonstrated these characteristics in different environments, especially in areas such as rescue, reconnaissance, health-care, security and marine environments [2]. Robots have been shown to be advantageous in applications involving dull, dirty and dangerous environments, and vital tasks such as nuclear decommissioning remain a key national priority. It is widely believed that over 50% of the earthâ€™s surface is inaccessible to wheels or tracks [2], and legged robots have an increasing role to play, judging by recent commercial successes such as ANYbotics [3] and cost-effective, open source systems such as Stanford Doggo [4] and the ODRI [5].
